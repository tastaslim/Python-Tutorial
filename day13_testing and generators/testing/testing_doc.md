# Testing # 

- It is one of the most important aspect of software development. This must be mastered to become a good software
  developer.
- Testing is very important to check functionality of our code/functions so that we can verify that our code is doing
  the same thing which we expect(Generally developers do unit testing.)
- In Python, we have a module named unittest which we use for unit testing.
- The developers are expected to write automated test scripts, which ensures that each and every section or a unit meets
  its design and behaves as expected.
- Unit testing makes your code future-proof since you anticipate the cases where your code could potentially fail or
  produce a bug. Though you cannot predict all the cases, you still address most of them.
- A unit could be bucketed into various categories:
    - An entire module,
    - An individual function,
    - A complete interface like a class or a method.
