You can think of Docker as lightweight virtual machines â€” that contain everything you need to run an application.
A docker container can capture a snapshot of the state of your system so that someone else can quickly re-create your
compute environment.
It's one time pain, once you have dockerized your application, you can run it on any machine, and It is guaranteed
to run on any machine.
