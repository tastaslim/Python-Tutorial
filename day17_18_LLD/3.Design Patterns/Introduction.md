While using design patterns, think twice about the following:
When a solution gets repeated over and over in various projects, someone eventually puts a name to it and describes the
solution in detail. Thatâ€™s basically how a pattern gets discovered.

- Design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design, over the time
  people found what common problems and common solutions to them, they generalised those solutions into design patterns.
- Does your problem really need it, or you just read it, and it looks cool to you.(Novices face this problem)
- Always think that can a simple code solve your problem? If not then you can think about any design pattern that can
  solve your problem.
- Design patterns are not straight forward and strict rules, these are tools which we use to solve a particular type of
  problem. Hence, the ones who are going to implement these must be aware of problems first, which they are facing.

# Fundamental of Design Patterns #

- Always separate out those things which keep on changing from those which doesn't so that any new change will have
  no/minimum impact on other things.
- Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems.
  While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level
  description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.
- An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern
  is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is
  up to you.
