# Creational Design Patterns #

These design patterns are all about class instantiation (various methods of object creation which increase the
flexibility and re-usability of code). These patterns can be further divided into class-creation patterns and
object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process,
object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

It contains the following patterns:

1. Factory Method
2. Abstract Factory
3. Builder
4. Prototype
5. Singleton
