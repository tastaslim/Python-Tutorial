# Bloaters #

- ## Long Methods/Functions ##
    - Any method that contains more than **15** lines of code is considered to be a bloater.
    - Simple way to find it, If inside your function, it takes a comment to describe what that part is doing, it is
      better to put that part in a separate method (It does not matter whether code is 2-3 lines or more) and use it.
    - Always name your sub-methods in such a manner that no one needs to go inside it to find out what it does.
    - The longer the method, the more likely it is to be a bloater, hard to understand, a better place to hide duplicate
      code and maintain.
    - Many people ask me that hey Taslim, why do you have so many methods? Won't it affect the performance of software?
      In almost all cases the impact is so negligible that it is not even worth worry.
    - Benefit of above approach is that now you have clear and understandable code, youâ€™re more likely to find truly
      effective methods for restructuring code and getting real performance gains if the need ever arises.

- ## Long Parameter Lists ##

Any method that has more than **3 or 4** parameters is considered to be a bloater.

- ## Long Class ##

If your class contains too many methods or lines of code, it is considered to be a bloater. Every class starts with
small size and keeps on growing over the time. Programmers usually find it mentally less taxing to place a new feature
in an existing class than to create a new class for the feature.

- ## Parameter Reassignments ##

If you have a method that has a parameter that is passed in and then reassigned, it is considered to be a bloater.

  Bad Convention:

  const getDiscount=(amount:number):number=>{
      amount=amount*0.9;
      return amount;
  }

  Good ConventionðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡: 

  const getDiscount=(amount:number):number=>{
      const amountAfterDiscount=amount*0.9;
      return amountAfterDiscount;
  }
```

---

**Bad Convention:**

```                                       
getPayAmount(): number {
  let result: number;
  if (isDead){
    result = deadAmount();
  }
  else {
    if (isSeparated){
      result = separatedAmount();
    }
    else {
      if (isRetired){
        result = retiredAmount();
      }
      else{
        result = normalPayAmount();
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

**Good ConventionðŸ¥‡:**

```
getPayAmount(): number {
  if (isDead){
    return deadAmount();
  }
  if (isSeparated){
    return separatedAmount();
  }
  if (isRetired){
    return retiredAmount();
  }
  return normalPayAmount();
}
```

- ## Replace conditional with Polymorphism ## 

**Bad Convention**

```
class Bird {
  // ...
  getSpeed(): number {
    switch (type) {
      case EUROPEAN:
        return getBaseSpeed();
      case AFRICAN:
        return getBaseSpeed() - getLoadFactor() * numberOfCoconuts;
      case NORWEGIAN_BLUE:
        return (isNailed) ? 0 : getBaseSpeed(voltage);
    }
    throw new Error("Should be unreachable");
  }
}
```

**Good Convention**

```
abstract class Bird {
  // ...
  abstract getSpeed(): number;
}

class European extends Bird {
  getSpeed(): number {
    return getBaseSpeed();
  }
}
class African extends Bird {
  getSpeed(): number {
    return getBaseSpeed() - getLoadFactor() * numberOfCoconuts;
  }
}
class NorwegianBlue extends Bird {
  getSpeed(): number {
    return (isNailed) ? 0 : getBaseSpeed(voltage);
  }
}

// Somewhere in client code
const speed = bird.getSpeed();
```

- A method should do only one task like a verb does. It should have a generic name.

```
Bad Convention:
performAdditionAndCalculateInterest(), raiseByTenPercent(), raiseByFivePercent()

Good ConventionðŸ¥‡: 
addition(), calculateInterest() , raise(percent)
```
