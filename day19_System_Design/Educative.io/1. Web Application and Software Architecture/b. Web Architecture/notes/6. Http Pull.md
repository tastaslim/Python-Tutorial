## Http Pull and Push ##

- There are two modes of data transfer between the client and the server: HTTP PUSH and HTTP PULL. Letâ€™s find out what
  they are and what they do.

## HTTP PULL ##

- As I stated earlier, for every response, there has to be a request first. The client sends the request and the server
  responds with the data. This is the default mode of HTTP communication, called the HTTP PULL mechanism. The client
  keeps on sending requests to the server within a defined time interval to get a response from server. Meaning client
  has to poll server for data.
- There are some technologies involved in the HTTP PULL-based mechanism, such as:
    - Ajax polling
    - Manually polling the server (Say by refreshing the page / using refresh button)

### Pros ###

- Since it is stateless communication, server doesn't need to know about client and vice versa. Every call is
  independent of the previous one as for every call a connection is opened b/w client and server, and it is closed
  once the response is sent (Hence it consumes less memory).
- It is easy to implement, scale.

### Cons ###

- It is not efficient as the client has to poll the server for data. Excessive pulls by the clients have the potential
  to bring down the server and every hit on the server costs the business money and adds to the unnecessary load on the
  server, CPU.
- We don't get the real time data. We have to wait for the next poll to get the data.

Imagine, you implement a Pull based system, and you have 1000 clients. Now, if each client polls the server every
5 seconds, then the server will be hit 1000 times every 5 seconds. This is a lot of load on the server. Also for a
mobile app, it is not a good idea to poll the server every x seconds. It will drain the battery of the mobile device.

### HTTP Pull - Polling With AJAX ###

- AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is used for adding asynchronous behavior to the web page.

  As you can see in the illustration above, instead of requesting the data manually every time with the click of a
  button, AJAX enables us to fetch the updated data from the server by automatically sending the requests over and over
  at stipulated intervals.
- Upon receiving the updates, a particular section of the web page is updated dynamically by the callback method. We see
  this behavior all the time on news and sports websites, where the updated event information is dynamically displayed
  on the page without needing to reload it.
- AJAX uses an XMLHttpRequest object to send the requests to the server. This object is built in the browser and uses
  JavaScript to update the HTML DOM (Document Object Model).
- AJAX is commonly used with the jQuery framework to implement the asynchronous behavior on the UI.
- This dynamic technique of requesting information from the server at regular intervals is known as polling.

``` text 
It is important to note here that AJAX polling and AJAX Long polling are different techniques. Do not confuse them as
one. AJAX polling is the HTTP Pull mechanism and AJAX Long polling is a hybrid between the HTTP Push and the Pull, based
on the BAYEUX protocol.
