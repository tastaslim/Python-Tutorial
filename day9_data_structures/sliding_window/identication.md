1. These question would be solved using 2 loops but if you consider we will be doing repetitive work.
2. Question would be of array/string
3. Something would be related to subarray/substring
4. Some window size k would be given (Fixed Window size)
5. There is another variation where they would be asking the window size which comes under
   variable window size category (Questions like largest subarray with some condition, minimum length substring with
   some condition)
